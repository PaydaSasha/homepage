                  <p><small>season 21 episode 20: <b>To Surveil, with Love</b></small></p>
                  Springfield installs surveillance cameras (like London) after a bomb scare, and Flanders ends up in
                  charge of it. In a rare moment of corruption, Flanders becomes Big Brother. A defiant Homer finds a
                  spot in his backyard where the cameras can’t see and breaks all of Flanders’ rules. This episode
                  became even more prescient after the Edward Snowden leaks.

                <li>
                  <p><small>season 24 episode 15: <b>Black-Eyed Please</b></small></p>
                  We knew that Flanders could succumb to violent instincts as a few other episodes on this list show.
                  There’s only so much Homer Simpson you can take, and in this episode, he actually takes a swing at
                  Homer and gives him a black eye. To make it even worse, Homer won’t hit back. He figures out that he
                  can be the better man and hold it over Flanders’ head. This episode also gives us a glimpse at Ned and
                  Edna Krabappel in bed together (see below), a song “Hey Diddly, Hell Diddly” and the line “I’m
                  insisting on a fisting!”

                  <p><small>season 26 episode 21: <b>Bull-E</b></small></p>
                  A timely episode due to the rash of school bullying incidents in real life, Springfield passes an
                  anti-bullying law and Homer gets sent to a sensitivity course. When Homer actually reforms, Ned
                  refuses to forgive him. It takes Homer actually practicing true repentance, kneeling biblical style on
                  the Flanders lawn, for Ned to accept his apology. It’s nice to see Flanders rub off on Homer, at least
                  briefly.

                  <p><small>season 3 episode 3: <b>When Flanders Failed</b></small></p>
                  This is the classic episode in which Flanders opened The Leftorium in the mall, a store devoted to
                  left-handed accessories for left handed people. At first, Homer enjoys the schadenfreude of watching
                  The Leftorium go bankrupt, but when he hears a bunch of lefties lamenting how hard it is to use right
                  handed stuff, he can’t help but send the customers Ned’s way. The Leftorium would remain the Flanders
                  family business ever since.

                  <p><small>season 16 episode 8: <b>Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass</b></small></p>
                  The hook of this episode was Homer’s celebration dance videos and cameos from famous athletes (it
                  aired after a Super Bowl). Homer’s viral video success inspires Flanders to make his own biblical
                  movies, seemingly inspired by the intensity of The Passion of the Christ. It’s a great spoof of The
                  Passion, and The Simpsons called it. Faith-based movies have become big business

                  <p><small>season 4 episode 2: <b>A Streetcar named Marge</b></small></p>
                  This is where we learn that Flanders is ripped underneath that green sweater. Marge is cast as Blanch
                  Dubois in a musical version of A Streetcar Named Desire, with Flanders as Stanley Kowalski. This is
                  one of many Simpsons musical renditions of a movie with catchy tunes. They actually got in trouble
                  with the City of New Orleans for their opening number.

                  <p><small>season 12 episode 19: <b>I’m Goin’ to Praiseland</b></small></p>
                  One year after the death of his wife Maude Flanders, Ned tries dating again. Poor Christian Rock
                  singer Rachel Jordan ends up getting the Maude haircut, this after sleeping around Maude’s year-old
                  indent in the bed. Faced with really getting rid of Maude’s stuff, Ned finds her sketches for a
                  faith-based amusement park and tries to build it in her honor. Praiseland doesn’t last, nor does his
                  relationship with Rachel.

                  <p><small>season 10 episode 10: <b>Viva Ned Flanders</b></small></p>
                  In this one, we learn that Ned is actually 60 years old! Clean living keeps him looking younger than
                  Homer. Trying to get show Ned a wild good time, Homer takes him to Las Vegas but gets in over their
                  heads when they drunkenly marry two showgirls. There’s a great Viva Las Vegas chase through the casino
                  and the “floozies” have shown up again in later episodes.
